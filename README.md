# SymmetrySTEM

Application to analyse SymmetrySTEM signals in 4D-STEM datasets. 

To build the application, you will require a Linux PC, standard build system libraries and ArrayFire library.
The executable can be compiled by:

``` 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The code then can be used as by executing ```./symmetry``` in terminal. Running the code without any parameters will give a help.
